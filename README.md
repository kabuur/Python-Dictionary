# Python Dictionary

This repository contains Python scripts demonstrating examples and concepts related to dictionaries in Python. Dictionaries are a powerful data structure in Python that allow you to store and retrieve data using key-value pairs.

## Scripts

1. `Creating_dictionary.py`: This script showcases how to create and populate a dictionary in Python. It demonstrates different ways to add key-value pairs to a dictionary and how to access and manipulate the data stored in the dictionary.

2. `VerseDictionary.py`: This script provides an example of a dictionary that stores information about famous verses. It demonstrates how to define a dictionary with meaningful key-value pairs and how to retrieve and present the information stored in the dictionary.

3. `nested_dictionary.py`: This script illustrates the concept of nested dictionaries in Python. It shows how you can create dictionaries within dictionaries to organize and represent hierarchical data structures.
